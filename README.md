- WEEK 4

The big project idea here is:
this is going to be a number (maybe letter formatter) menu for calling an easy intuitive menu to format numbers upon option request.

- WEEK 6

I changed my mind on a python formatter and decided to work on a project I never finished from last semester, that being my console-adventure game QUEST. I have a full flowchart that I am following, but I may deviate a little of I think of a better story idea.

As I go through this project, I am going to find a graphical interface media to illustrate or potentially compose music for this project. First order of business will be to get the text part to work, then we can configure it past that point.
