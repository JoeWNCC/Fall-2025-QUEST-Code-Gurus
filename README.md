## WEEK 4
The big project idea here is:
this is going to be a number (maybe letter formatter) menu for calling an easy intuitive menu to format numbers upon option request.

## WEEK 6
I changed my mind on a python formatter and decided to work on a project I never finished from last semester, that being my console-adventure game QUEST. I have a full flowchart that I am following, but I may deviate a little of I think of a better story idea.

As I go through this project, I am going to find a graphical interface media to illustrate or potentially compose music for this project. First order of business will be to get the text part to work, then we can configure it past that point.

## WEEK 11
I spent a lot of time trying to iron out errors in code I made from Spring 2025 and so far, I have really polished this to a way more understandable, workable state that I can continue to develop and add to.

I've taken some liberties from the flowchart to add new things. I would say it's important to use your reference as solely ideas rather than directions, so you are allowed to be creative beyond the initial planning faze. Of course, if you were working with other people on the same project, that would need to be communicated with everyone, but I don't have to worry about that as a perk of being a solo dev.
